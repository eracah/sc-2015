\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Matrix factorizations are an important class of linear algebra computations
with broad applications in Big Data analytics. In this work, we have
successfully developed highly optimized versions of the CX algorithm, both on a
single node, as well as distributed multi-node implementations. We utilize
Spark as a contemporary data analytics framework for developing and deploying
the CX algorithm, and successfully demonstrate the implementaton scaling up to
960 cores. We evaluate our parallel implementation on HPC and EC2 class
hardware; we find that faster interconnects enable the numerically intensive
computations to run more efficiently on HPC systems. Finally, this scalable
implementation was used to analyze a large scale, TB-sized mass-spec imaging
dataset; the resulting ion and spatial patterns obtained from the analysis are
providing biologist with novel insights on complex molecular mechanisms in
cells.
