\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Matrix factorizations are an important class of linear algebra computations with
 broad applications in Big Data analytics. In this work, we have successfully de
veloped highly optimized versions of the CX algorithm, both on a single node, as
 well as distributed multi-node implementations. We utilize Spark as a contempor
ary data analytics framework for developing and deploying the CX algorithm, and 
successfully demonstrate the implementaton scaling up to 960 cores. We evaluate 
our parallel implementation on HPC and EC2 class hardware; we find that faster i
nterconnects enable the numerically intensive computations to run more efficient
ly on HPC systems. Finally, this scalable implementation was used to analyze a l
arge scale, TB-sized mass-spec imaging dataset; the resulting ion and spatial pa
tterns obtained from the analysis are providing biologist with novel insights on
 complex molecular mechanisms in cells.
